# Maven-Projects
Hello there, my name is Amanda!
Wisconsinite here! Born and raised city girl living in the country. Traveling around the United States helped me appreciate nature and the world around it. I am passionate about learning new skills and applying them to real-world problems. Recently, I took the leap and decided to pursue a career change in the exciting world of data analytics. Completed the Google Data Analytics Professional certificate, (April  2024), wherein I have built a master toolbox of essential data analytics skills like data cleaning, SQL, Tableau, and R. To ehance my skills further, I have started a self-paced learning journey with Maven Analytics. Along with addition projects for my portfolio. I'm eagerly seeking an entry-level data analytics role where I can leverage my newfound expertise and drive data-driven decision-making.

My work experience includes customer service, human resources, training and staff development, profit/loss management, bookkeeping, organizing and verifying inventory. My interest in data analytics is bolstered by the diverse skill set I have built over my career. Through my professional experiences, I have developed a strong work ethic and careful, conscientious customer orientation. Furthermore, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a knack for solving problems. My natural curiosity inspires me to learn new skills, adapt to evolving trends, and cull together insights that can help boost the bottom line. 

I thrive in cross-functional teams where I can share perspectives, learn from others, and deliver results. I'm on a mission to make data a driving force for transformation in today's business landscape. Let's connect and embark on a journey where data isn't just information, it's a catalyst for positive change. Whenever possible, remember to stop and embrace the day!
